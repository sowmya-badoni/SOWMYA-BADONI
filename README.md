# 👋 Hey there! I'm Sowmya Badoni

I'm a B.Tech student in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, on a mission to turn curiosity into real-world impact using data and machine learning.

Right now, I’m learning by doing — one project at a time.
## 🚀 What I’m up to:
- 💡 Exploring data science and applied ML
- 🛠️ Getting better at version control and deployment (GitHub, Streamlit, etc.)
- 📚 Learning to write cleaner code and tell better stories with data


## 🌱 What I’m learning next:
- More projects → small, useful, and focused  
- Model evaluation, better visualizations, and maybe some APIs  
- Making my GitHub and resume internship-ready

## 📫 Let's Connect
If you're into data, learning, or just figuring things out one step at a time — I’m right there with you.
